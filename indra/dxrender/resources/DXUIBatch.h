// Native D3D11 2D-quad/text batch renderer - see the DXUIBatch plan (project
// memory + the session plan file that introduced it). 2D UI/text never needs
// LLVertexBuffer's general-purpose, up-to-11-input-slot struct-of-arrays
// machinery (built for normals/tangents/skinning weights/texture indices
// that 2D UI never uses) - this is the dedicated, minimal alternative:
// one interleaved vertex format, one input slot, no index buffer.
//
// One interleaved vertex matching interface/uiV.hlsl's VSInput exactly
// (POSITION float3 @0, COLOR0 R8G8B8A8_UNORM @12, TEXCOORD0 float2 @16,
// stride 24 bytes) - see DXVertexLayout::getOrCreateUILayout().

// already-correct GL-era geometry construction code already produces

// callers translate their existing pos/uv/color arrays into DXUIVertex
// directly rather than this class re-deriving a dedup'd vertex+index

// supports with no CPU-side reshaping (see DXRender2DUtils.h's header
// comment for GL_LINE_LOOP/GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, which have no native D3D11
// equivalent and are expanded to LineStrip/TriangleList by the caller
// before reaching push()/flush() at all).

// S24 (2026-08-16): real cross-primitive batching, replacing the previous
// "draw immediately every single flush() call" design that made 2D UI cost
// scale linearly with widget count (a floater with hundreds of rects/icons/
// text labels meant hundreds of full D3D11 state-replay Draw() calls per
// frame - confirmed root cause of the UI-floater framerate floor). Every
// existing push()+flush(...) call site (21 across llrender2dutils.cpp/
// llfontgl.cpp) is UNCHANGED - flush()'s signature and call pattern stay
// exactly the same; what changed is what it does internally:
//
// flush() now compares the (shader, topology, alpha_blend, depth) state it
// was called with against whatever's currently pending. If it matches (or
// nothing's pending yet), the just-pushed vertices simply extend the
// pending batch - no draw happens. If it differs, the OLD pending batch is
// drawn first (using ITS OWN remembered state), then a new pending batch
// starts with the vertices just pushed for the new state. This turns
// "hundreds of draws, one per primitive" into "a handful of draws, one per
// actual state change" - state changes are rare in practice (per-file
// investigation: alpha_blend is true and depth params are default at every
// one of the 21 existing call sites bar one HUD case, so real-world batches
// are usually keyed on shader+topology alone, i.e. one whole floater's
// worth of same-shader rects/text often merges into ONE draw call).
//
// flushPending() is new: unconditionally draws whatever's pending (if
// anything) right now. This is what every interleaving-hazard hook (scissor
// rect changes, depth-state changes, blend/cull changes, the separate
// LLRender/gDX immediate-mode queue's own flush, texture changes, shader
// bind/unbind, HUD-vs-screen-space pass boundaries) calls BEFORE actually
// changing D3D11 state out from under a still-pending batch - without these
// hooks, deferring flush() would risk silent draw-order corruption. See the
// DXUIBatch batching plan (2026-08-16 session) for the full hazard audit
// and the complete list of hook sites.

    // correct under the depth convention at the time (near=0.0/far=1.0,
    // "nearer" = smaller stored value, so "this fragment is nearer-or-equal"
    // = LESS_EQUAL). The reversed-Z conversion (task #289, 2026-08-30,
    // near=1.0/far=0.0) flipped that everywhere else in the codebase
    // (glDepthFuncToDX(), the shadow-comparison sampler, etc.) but this
    // class's own hardcoded default was never revisited - "nearer" is now
    // the LARGER stored value, so the correct "this fragment is nearer-or-
    // equal" comparison is GREATER_EQUAL. No live caller currently passes
    // depth_test=true (confirmed via grep across every gDXUIBatch.flush()
    // call site), so this was a genuinely stale, currently-inert bug -
    // fixed now so the capability is actually correct whenever a future

    // turns it on, rather than leaving it silently backwards.
