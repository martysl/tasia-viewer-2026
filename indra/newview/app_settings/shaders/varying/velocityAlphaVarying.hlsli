// Shared vertex-to-pixel varying struct for velocityAlphaV.hlsl/
// velocityAlphaF.hlsl - see varying/uiVarying.hlsli's comment for why this
// exists. Deliberately does NOT include vary_texture_index (present under
// HAS_DIFFUSE_LOOKUP) - DXShader::injectTextureIndexInputs() (dxrender/
// resources/DXShader.cpp) textually inserts a hardcoded
// "OUT.vary_texture_index = vary_texture_index;" assignment, so that field
// must stay a direct top-level VSOutput/PSInput member, not nested here -
// same reasoning as pbrterrainF.hlsl's SV_IsFrontFace field.
