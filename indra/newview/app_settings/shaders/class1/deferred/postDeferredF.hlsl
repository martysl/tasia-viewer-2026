// t0-t3/s0-s3 reserved by deferredUtil.hlsl (attached below,

// inv_proj/screen_res are also declared by deferredUtil.hlsl, grouped
// together there under one guard. inv_proj itself is never referenced in
// this file, but deferredUtil.hlsl's own getPosition() (attached
// regardless of whether this file calls it - its body still needs to
// type-check) uses inv_proj internally, so both names must be declared
// together here even though only screen_res is used below - matching the
// exact same declared set as deferredUtil.hlsl's guarded block (same
// "guard grouping" lesson as blurLightF.hlsl's fix earlier this session -
// deleting inv_proj alone would leave it undeclared once this block's
// guard trips deferredUtil.hlsl's later one to skip).
